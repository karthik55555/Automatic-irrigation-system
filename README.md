# Automatic-Irrigation-System
Irrigation is the application of controlled amounts of water to plants at needed intervals. Irrigation helps to grow agricultural crops, maintain landscapes, and revegetate disturbed soils in dry areas and during periods of less than average rainfall. Irrigation also has other uses in crop production, including frost protection,suppressing weed growth in grain fields and preventing soil consolidation. In contrast, agriculture that relies only on direct rainfall is referred to as rain-fed or dry land farming.
Here we use four kind of sensors such as wireless soil moisture sensor,raindrop sensor,waterlevel sensor,temperature & humidity.

ADVANTAGES
*EACH AND EVERY CROPS DO DIFFER IN WATER LEVEL.
*WE USE WIRELESS SOIL MOISTURE SENSOR SO THAT LAYING OF WIRES WONT BE SO DIFFICULT AND IT WONT CAUSE ANY DAMAGES.
